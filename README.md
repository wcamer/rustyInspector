# Overview
This is an introductory project for the a beginner in the Rust coding language.  What I set out to accomplish was to create a hide and go seek game with simple elements.


## Description
This is a command-line interface game called Rusty Inspector.  This game was coded in Rust and has the following features, user input/output, struct declaration and manipulation, variable declaration and manipulation, and conditionals.  The main purpose of this project is to gain experience with this new coding language and build a game that can be improved on with future updates.

# Future Work
- Something to fix, I would get the random number generator working to randomize the CPU's hiding spot and guesses.
- Something to improve, I would add input validation. 
- Somnething to add in the future, I would add abilities and levels (like depth and height) to the board.
